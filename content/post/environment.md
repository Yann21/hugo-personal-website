Over the course of the last 8 months, coinciding roughly with the onset of the covid-19 pandemic,
I have made the shift to a Windows-free, 99.2% automated working setup.
Let's just say that this was one of the most meaningful steps I've took on my
journey to become a better Computer Scientist. I've learned about bash, systemd,
the linux kernel and drivers, partitions and file system, hardware and firmware
and ransomware, about window managers and the myriad of bits and pieces that
make up a modern operating system, whether you like it canned Windows- or Linux- style.
